					<p>We offer support groups for children ages 3 through 19. We have separate groups for children and teens that are grieving the loss of someone they love because of death, divorce or separation. We also help children who are in foster care, and those with anticipitory grief.</p>

					<p>A typical group includes up to 10 children and 5 trained volunteer facilitators and staff. An adult family member or care-giver must accompany each child and may participate in the adult support group which meets at the same time the children and teens meet.</p>

					<p>A Center For Grieving Children offers mutual support and acceptance through listening and sharing. We believe grief is a natural reaction to the loss of a loved one for children as well as adults and that acceptance and caring assist in the healing process. Our goals are to support and nurture children and their families in a loving and understanding environment as they experience grief.</p>
