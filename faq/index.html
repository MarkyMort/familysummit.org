            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <p><b>Q. What is The Family Summit Foundation - A Center For Grieving Children?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> A Center For Grieving Children is a support center for children, teens and their families who are grieving the loss of someone they love because of death, divorce or separation. We also have support groups for children in foster care, and consultations for families with anticipatory grief.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. Do you provide counseling?</b></p>
			<p><b>A.</b> We are not a counseling clinic, and we do not offer professional therapy sessions. We provide support groups, information, and consultations to help those who are grieving to promote the healing process. All volunteer facilitators are trained in child and teen grief during a mandatory workshop. Our staff who work with the families and children have degrees in, or in fields relating to, Child Development and Family Relations, with specific training in childhood bereavement.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. What does your program for children and teens consist of?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> We provide peer support groups for children and teens from 3 to 19 years of age. All the groups meet twice a month for 1 1/2 hours.</p>

            <p>There are separate nights for those experiencing the death of a loved one, for those experiencing divorce or separation, and for children in foster care. When they arrive, the youth are divided into groups by age where they engage in activities which allow them to express their thoughts and feelings. These activities include a "talking circle" as well as games, music, art, working with clay and journal writing.</p>

            <p>The children and teens are never required to talk--they participate as they feel comfortable doing so. All the groups are facilitated by trained volunteers and professional staff of A Center For Grieving Children. Each group has up to 10 children or teens and up to 5 volunteers/staff facilitators.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. Do you have support groups for adults too?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> Yes we offer support groups for the adult family member(s) or care-giver who accompanies the children or teens to their groups. The adult support groups meet at the same time and on the same night as the respective children's or teen's group.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. How do I get my child/teen started?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> A parent or legal guardian should call our Center at (801) 476-1127. A staff member will take down basic information and arrangements will be made for an orientation.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. What happens at the orientation meeting?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> Information about our programs will be provided, and questions will be answered. Parents will come away with an understanding of normal behaviors that their children may be experiencing. Necessary forms will be filled out at this time, and a tour of our facilities will be given.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. What is the cost?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> There is no charge for attending. A Center For Grieving Children is a non-profit organization supported through foundations and private donations. All donations are appreciated.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>Q. How long after the death does a family need to wait before calling?</b></p>
            <p><b>A.</b> A family can call as soon as they think they are ready to start the process for participation. We believe each person and family is unique, and that the family can best determine when they are ready to attend a support group.</p>
