				 <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

				<p><b>Q. What is The Family Summit Foundation - A Center For Grieving Children?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> A Center For Grieving Children is a support center for children, teens and their families who are grieving the loss of someone they love because of death, divorce or separation. We also have support groups for children in foster care, and consultations for families with anticipatory grief.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. Do you provide counseling?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> We are not a counseling clinic, and we do not offer professional therapy sessions. We provide support groups, information, and consultations to help those who are grieving to promote the healing process. All volunteer facilitators are trained in child and teen grief during a mandatory workshop. Our staff who work with the families and children have degrees in, or in fields relating to, Child Development and Family Relations, with specific training in childhood bereavement.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. What does your program for children and teens consist of?</b></p>
				
				<p><b>A.</b> We provide peer support groups for children and teens from 3 to 19 years of age. All the groups meet twice a month for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
				
				<p>There are separate nights for those suffering from the death of a loved one, for those suffering due to divorce or separation, and children in foster care. When they arrive, the children are divided into smaller groups by age where they engage in activities which allow them to express their thoughts and feelings. These activities include a "talking circle" as well as games, music, art, working with clay and journal writing.</p>

				<p>There are also teen groups (ages 13-19), again for those suffering from the death of a loved one, for those suffering due to divorce or separation, and those in foster care. During the teens' sessions, the participants talk and participate in journal writing, or any of the other activities.</p>

				<p>The children and teens are never required to talk--they participate as they feel comfortable doing so. All the groups are facilitated by trained volunteers and professional staff of A Center For Grieving Children. Each group has up to 10 children or teens and up to 5 volunteers/staff facilitators.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. Do you have support groups for adults too?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> Yes we offer support groups for the adult family member(s) or care-giver who accompanies the children or teens to their groups. The adult support groups meet at the same time and on the same night as the respective children's or teen's group.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. How do I get my child/teen started?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> A parent or legal guardian should call our Center at (801) 476-1127. The staff member will take down some basic information and arrangements will be made for an orientation meeting. Questions about the center will be answered at this time.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. What happens at the orientation meeting?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> You will be given a tour of our facilities and you will be introduced to our staff members. More information about our program will be given and you will have the opportunity to ask more questions about our organization. Application forms will be filled out at this time.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. What is the cost?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> There is no charge for attending. A Center For Grieving Children is a non-profit organization supported through foundations and private donations. All donations are appreciated.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Q. How long after the death does a family need to wait before calling?</b></p>

				<p><b>A.</b> A family can call as soon as they think they are ready to start the process for participation. We believe each person and family are unique, and that the family can best determine when they are ready to attend a support group.</p>
